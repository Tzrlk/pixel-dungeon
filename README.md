Unleashed Pixel Dungeon is a game based on the Open Source Shattered Pixel Dungeon, with permission from Evan of Shattered Pixel. I am attempting to take the game in a new direction by adding new features across the board.  Differences from Shattered Pixel include:
- load / save functionality at level entrance signs
- larger level sizes with more mobs, rooms and loot
- new dungeon features including archways
- Holy Altars where you can donate goods for divine intervention
- new dungeon rooms - altars and prisons
- new weapon enchantments: Glowing and Artifact weapons
- useful item drops in high-grass
- five new levels added to the dungeon along with new mobs
- new level types - Burnt levels
- your hero can now go to even higher levels, and you get slight buffs on level up
- your quick-slot buttons now auto-aim on a mob if none is selected
- items now have level caps, with a chance of failure for higher levels
- more scrolls of upgrade available
- better descriptions of armor enchantments
- lots of tweaks to maintain game balance and fun

I hope you enjoy the changes, and I look forward to adding new features in the near future.  Please stay tuned for updates!
